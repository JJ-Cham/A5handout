## Reflection

Reflection on your experience with this assignment: I enjoyed seeing the assignment actually work after compiling and running postfix. Infix was a bit difficult for me to put together because of the going from postfix to infix. I liked thinking about how to implement phase 4 with precedence and the exponent.
